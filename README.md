# Enhancement-ultrasonic-tomographic-image
U-net plus transfer learning

This project is to enhance the quality of ultrasonic tomography images of plates, using segmentation techniques and U-Net architecture. 

In order to improve the capabilities of the U-net architecture and enhance the computation time and cost. Transfer learning was used using EfficientNetB7 as a backbone
